I chose one item from each section and combined them to see if it would result in a potential concept for my product. I ended up with a good few, but none compared to the combination of Health (Speech), Siri and Daily. This sparked the idea of conceptualising way for people with speech difficulties/impairments to engage with Siri and access all the content she has to offer.  </p>

The blue ring on the Amazon Echo, the flashes of blue we see when talking to Siri - this colour has become synonymous with conversational design. </p>
