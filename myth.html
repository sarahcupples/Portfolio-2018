I chose one item from each section and combined them to see if it would result in a potential concept for my product. I ended up with a good few, but none compared to the combination of Health (Speech), Siri and Daily. This sparked the idea of conceptualising way for people with speech difficulties/impairments to engage with Siri and access all the content she has to offer.  </p>

Keeping the palette stripped back was important in ensuring that there was some sort of assimilance between the rings and voice assistants. And what better colour than blue to do this job? The blue ring on the Amazon Echo, the flashes of blue we see when talking to Siri - this colour has become synonymous with conversational design. </p>
